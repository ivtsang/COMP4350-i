ConnectR is a research-oriented social platform that connects professors and students.This project is all about creating
a social networking platform where faculties, researchers and prospective students can collaborate with each other. This platform
will help them not only to connect but also it will provide more interactive features just like any other social networking site
provides. Every year a significant number of students specially graduate (both M.Sc and Phd) students search for potential
supervisors, labs, faculty members to pursue their higher studies e.g. masters or PhD in their desired research field, may be in
their desired university. We have done some requirement analysis and found some interesting facts about how normally students 
achieve this. However, student’s current usual procedure of finding professors are confined to search for faculty members with
their matched research interest in their desired department of many universities around the world and most of the cases, this is
only possible by searching though internet randomly and is really a time consuming procedure. Wouldn’t be great if there is a
platform through which faculties, researchers around the world not only can collaborate with each other but also with the huge
number of prospective students and it will be really beneficial for both the sides. Actually this is our main motivation of doing
this project and as there is no current application that can ease this time consuming process, we believe it will bring a major
difference in how the current process works. Faculties, students will have their profile on our platform and our platform will
help them to find whatever they wants. This platform will not be confined with advanced searching capability but also messaging
system, recommendation, sharing profiles, collaborating by creating groups etc.
